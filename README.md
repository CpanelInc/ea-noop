# Purpose
This package was created in order to allow the installation of package dependencies on other Ubuntu versions that are not available on U20. Example: libavif-bin is available on u22 and higher but not u20, therefore we need a way for a package that Requires it, such as ea-php81-php-gd, to install it only on u22 and higher otherwise install this package which does nothing besides satisfy the requirement. This can be achieved with adding 'libavif-bin | ea-noop' into the '%replacements' hash of control.pm in the ea-tools pkg
